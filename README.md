# VanMoof Assignment - Option A

## The task

Probably you have seen fans in a stadium stand up and raise their hands in a synchronised way, creating a wave-like motion that travels through the crowd.

This is called Mexican Wave and letâ€™s try to do the same with strings. You will get an input string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.

## Solution

### Java

The solution in Java can be found in the `code/example/java/Wave.java` file. It reads the input string from the command line arguments, creates a `StringBuilder` object to efficiently manipulate the string, loops through the string character by character, and creates a new string for each wave iteration. Finally, the resulting wave list is printed to the console.

### Python

The solution in Python can be found in the `code/example/python/wave.py` file. It takes a string input, converts it to lowercase, loops through the string character by character, and creates a new string for each wave iteration. The resulting wave list is returned.

### JavaScript

The solution in JavaScript can be found in the `code/example/javascript/wave.js` file. It takes a string input, converts it to lowercase, loops through the string character by character using a regular expression, and creates a new string for each wave iteration. The resulting wave list is printed to the console.

## How to Run

### Java

To run the Java program, navigate first to the `code/example/java` directory and execute the following command to compile the class:

```
javac Wave.java
```

Then, go to the root directory and run:

```
java Wave 'input string'
```

Replace "input string" with the string you want to convert to a wave pattern.

### Python

To run the Python program, navigate to the `python` directory and execute the following command:

```
python3 wave.py "input string"
```

Replace "input string" with the string you want to convert to a wave pattern.

### JavaScript

To run the JavaScript program, navigate to the `javascript` directory and execute the following command:

```
node wave.js "input string"
```

Replace "input string" with the string you want to convert to a wave pattern.

## Conclusion

This solution provides a way to convert a string into a wave pattern in Java, Python, and JavaScript. The complexity of all solutions is O(n).
